# Play with DAO - Create a DAO in TVM Networks

The `DaoRoot` contract is a core component of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) system written in Ever-Solidity. It serves as the root contract managing proposals, configurations, staking accounts, and interactions with other modules within the DAO. Here's a structured explanation:

---

### **1. Imports and Dependencies**
The contract imports libraries, interfaces, and utility components to provide essential functionality:

- **Structures:** `PlatformTypes` defines types used within the DAO system.
- **Libraries:** Includes utility libraries for gas management (`Gas`), error handling (`DaoErrors`), and message flag operations (`MsgFlag`).
- **Interfaces:** Interfaces like `IDaoRoot`, `IStakingAccount`, and `IProposer` define the interaction points for proposals, staking accounts, and upgradability.
- **Utilities:** Additional utilities (`Delegate`, `DaoCellEncoder`) support encoding, delegation, and managing data.

---

### **2. Contract Constants**
These constants define the operational limits and parameters of the DAO:

- **Proposal Limits:** Maximum operations per proposal, description length, and thresholds for proposal quorum, voting period, delay, time lock, and grace period.
- **Static Variables:** `_nonce` is a unique identifier.

---

### **3. State Variables**
Key state variables manage the configuration and current status of the DAO:

- **Addresses:** `stakingRoot` points to the staking system, `admin` and `pendingAdmin` manage DAO administration.
- **Proposals:** `proposalCount`, `proposalConfiguration`, and `proposalCode` handle the state of proposals.
- **Deployment:** `deployEventValue` manages the value required for Ethereum event deployments.

---

### **4. Modifiers**
Modifiers enforce access control and validation:

- `onlyAdmin`: Restricts functions to the admin or delegated roles.
- `onlyProposal`: Ensures that only valid proposals can call certain functions.
- `onlyStakingAccount`: Restricts calls to authorized staking accounts.

---

### **5. Constructor**
The constructor initializes the DAO:

- **Parameters:** Platform code, initial proposal configuration, and the admin address.
- **Validation:** Ensures the admin address and configuration are valid.

---

### **6. Getter Functions**
Read-only functions provide public access to key data like `admin`, `proposalCount`, and expected addresses for proposals or staking accounts.

---

### **7. Proposal Functions**
Core functionality for managing proposals:

- **Propose:** Accepts new proposals, validates actions, and interacts with the staking account for submission.
- **DeployProposal:** Deploys proposals with unique IDs and initializes platform state.
- **Proposal Actions:** `onProposalSucceeded` executes proposal actions (Ton and Ethereum-based) when approved.
- **Helpers:** Functions to calculate gas costs for actions (`calcTonActionsValue`, `calcEthActionsValue`).

---

### **8. Admin Functions**
Administrative operations manage configurations and upgrades:

- **Configuration Updates:** Modify parameters like voting delay, quorum, thresholds, and event configurations.
- **Admin Management:** Transfer or accept admin rights.
- **Code Upgrades:** Allows upgrading the contract logic and proposals through the `upgrade` function.

---

### **9. Internal Utilities**
Internal functions handle lower-level tasks:

- **State Initialization:** Functions like `buildProposalStateInit` prepare the state for proposals.
- **Validation:** Ensures that configurations (e.g., voting periods, thresholds) meet predefined limits.
- **Delegation:** Manage delegation for certain operations.

---

### **10. Event Emissions**
The contract emits events for key actions, such as proposal creation, admin transfer, configuration updates, and upgrades, ensuring transparency.

---

### **11. Security and Gas Management**
The contract uses `tvm.rawReserve` to optimize gas usage and prevent attacks by reserving the required balance for operations.

---

### **12. Upgradability**
The `upgrade` function facilitates contract upgrades by accepting new code and reinitializing the contract state.

---

### **Key Features Summary:**
1. **Proposal Management:** Create, deploy, and execute proposals with strict validation.
2. **Configuration Flexibility:** Update DAO parameters through admin functions.
3. **Staking Integration:** Tightly coupled with staking accounts for proposal submission.
4. **Access Control:** Multiple levels of restrictions ensure secure operations.
5. **Upgradability:** Future-proof design with support for logic upgrades.

This modular structure ensures scalability, security, and flexibility for a DAO system.
